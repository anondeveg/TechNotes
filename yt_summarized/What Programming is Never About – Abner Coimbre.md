## 🎯 Purpose of the Talk

To break down common misconceptions in programming, especially the overemphasis on code quality, structure, and academic "cleanliness"—and refocus on what programming is *actually about*: **problem-solving through data manipulation and computation**.

---

## 🧩 What Programming *Is*

> “Programming is about moving and transforming data to solve problems.”

- **Dan North’s definition**: Successful programmers don’t “craft” software, they move information effectively.
- **Noel’s definition**: Programming = creating a sequence of instructions to transform input data into output data.

### Core Idea:
Programming is about understanding and manipulating **data flow**, **signals**, and **behavior**—not about language-specific aesthetics or conventions.

---

## ❌ What Programming Is *Not About*

> “It’s never about the code.”

### Why:
- The **syntax, style, and naming** of code are just artifacts of the process.
- Good code doesn’t solve problems unless it’s part of a clear understanding of what needs to be computed.
- Educational material, especially in academia, often focuses too much on:
  - Pretty code
  - Naming conventions
  - Class structure
  - “Modeling the real world” via object names and methods

## 📚 Stories & Examples

### 1. **The Health Bar (Game Project)**
- Simple task: display a health bar in a game.
- Abner implemented it in 2 hours by realizing it’s just a rectangle that changes size on collision.
- His peer spent a **week**, writing verbose, “beautiful” code filled with methods like `increaseHealthBarByOne()`.
- The peer didn’t understand the **computation or representation**—just code structure.
- Moral: understanding what the program *needs to do* is more important than how the code looks.

### 2. **Screen Saver Exercise**
- Common misconception: students over-complicate design.
