Welcome to my second brain!  

This repo is where I collect and share all my programming journey materials, including:

- **Learning notes** on various programming topics  
- **Tech video summaries**  
- **Book summaries** related to software development and computer science  
- **Other helpful resources** I come across  

My goal is to create a centralized place for my growth as a programmer and to share knowledge with the community.

happy coding!
